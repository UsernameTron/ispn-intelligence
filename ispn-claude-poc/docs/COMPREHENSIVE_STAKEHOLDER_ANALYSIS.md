## CROSS-FUNCTIONAL THEMES & INSIGHTS

### Data Integration Opportunity
**Common Pattern:** All five executives struggle with fragmented data across systems
- Charlie Brenneman: 15-20 reports daily from disparate systems
- Bryon Gaddy: Manual reconciliation of GL, subledgers, external systems
- Scott Lauber: Weekly manual reporting from Asana, Salesforce, Finance GL
- Jeff Neblett: 15 information sources with no single source of truth
- Ty Sorensen: CRM, ticketing, usage data fragmented across platforms

**Solution:** Unified data integration layer accessing all core systems (Asana, Salesforce, Finance GL, support systems) enabling Claude to synthesize comprehensive intelligence across organization

### Reporting Automation Opportunity
**Common Pattern:** Significant manual reporting burden across executive team
- Charlie: 22.3 hours/week data gathering and synthesis
- Bryon: 40-50 hours/month close-related reporting
- Scott: 40 hours/quarter board package creation
- Jeff: 12+ hours/month board prep + 4 hours weekly synthesis
- Ty: 5-10 hours/week manual data compilation

**Solution:** Automated reporting system pulling from integrated data sources, generating executive-grade reports (board decks, dashboards, briefings) without manual assembly

### Strategic Time Liberation Opportunity
**Common Pattern:** Executives allocated 30-40% of time to strategic work but need 60-80%
- Charlie: 30% strategic focus (goal: 70%) = 20+ hours/week liberation
- Scott: Stretched between CFO and operational responsibilities
- Jeff: 40% strategic vs. 60% administrative synthesis = 20+ hours/week administration
- Ty: 40% selling vs. 40% admin (goal: 80% selling)

**Solution:** Automation freeing 20-30 hours/week per executive for strategic work = significant competitive advantage in decision speed and quality

### E-rate/Market-Specific Intelligence
**Unique to Ty Sorensen but critical for entire organization:**
- E-rate application calendar drives 40-50% of annual revenue
- Form 470 windows (Jan-March) and Form 471 deadlines (March-May) critical
- Predictive forecasting requires E-rate application tracking
- Sales strategy must align with E-rate seasonal patterns

**Solution:** Purpose-built E-rate tracking and forecasting models integrated into unified dashboard

### M&A Integration Visibility
**Critical for Jeff Neblett, relevant to Scott Lauber and Charlie Brenneman:**
- Managing integration of iGLASS Networks (2023), DxTEL (2025)
- Distributed systems across acquisitions (Genesys, separate finance systems, different CRMs)
- Integration scorecard tracking synergy realization
- Critical path dependencies between acquired and legacy operations

**Solution:** Unified M&A integration dashboard tracking synergy realization, consolidation, dependency management

### Risk Identification & Early Warning
**Applicable to all executives:**
- Initiative risks discovered too late (Brenneman)
- Audit findings recurring (Gaddy)
- Customer churn discovered at renewal time (Sorensen)
- M&A integration issues discovered mid-course (Neblett)

**Solution:** Predictive analytics monitoring identifying risks 2-3 weeks before becoming crises
