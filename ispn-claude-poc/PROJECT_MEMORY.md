# Project Memory Context

**Purpose & context**

Pete works at ISPN (pete.connor@ispn.com) focusing on operational efficiency and automation initiatives. His work involves analyzing business processes to identify automation opportunities that can deliver measurable ROI through time savings and cost reduction. He collaborates with executives like Charlie Brenneman (SVP Operations & Strategic Initiatives) on strategic initiatives and proof-of-concept implementations. Pete's approach emphasizes creating professional executive-ready documentation and business cases that clearly demonstrate financial impact and value propositions for automation investments.

**Current state**

Pete is actively working on ROI analysis for process automation, specifically evaluating n8n agentic workflows to automate Magic Mail access calls. He has concrete call volume data and cost structures ($17-18/hour agent costs, 5-minute manual process vs 30-second automated process) and is building business cases that show tangible savings (recent analysis showed 50.7 hours and $862-912 in quarterly cost reduction). He's also involved in implementing Operations Intelligence solutions at ISPN, working on a 4-week POC framework targeting significant value creation across multiple executives.

**Key learnings & principles**

Pete has learned the importance of focusing analysis on specific, well-defined use cases rather than over-extrapolating to broader scenarios. He values precision in ROI calculations and prefers concrete, data-driven business cases over theoretical projections. His experience shows that executive stakeholder analysis can reveal substantial operational pain points (like information overload from numerous daily reports and fragmented visibility across multiple systems) that translate into quantifiable automation opportunities worth millions in annual value.

**Approach & patterns**

Pete's methodology involves deep stakeholder analysis that goes beyond basic profiling to understand operational workflows and pain points. He structures implementations in phased approaches (like 4-week POC frameworks) with specific targets and measurable outcomes. His work progresses from baseline establishment through incremental capability building, with each phase targeting specific efficiency improvements (60-87% time reduction targets). He consistently creates professional documentation formatted for executive review and decision-making.

**Tools & resources**

Pete works with n8n for workflow automation, Asana for project management (using comprehensive task management with custom fields, dependencies, and hierarchical structures), and HubSpot for CRM operations. He creates professional DOCX documents using structured formatting with tables, headers, and corporate styling for executive presentations. His technical approach includes using specific Asana API functions for task management and creating detailed documentation with proper formatting elements like borders, shading, and professional color schemes.
