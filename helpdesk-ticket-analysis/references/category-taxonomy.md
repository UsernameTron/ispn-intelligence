```python
category_groups = {
    'Connectivity': [
        'Connectivity Basic', 'Connectivity', 'Connectivity Advanced',
        'Intermittent Connectivity Issues', 'Intermittent Connectivity Issue',
        'Speed Issues', 'Speed Issue', 'speed issues'
    ],
    'Outage': ['OUTAGE', 'Outage'],
    'Equipment': [
        'Router WiFi', 'Router Wifi', 'Modem/Router WiFi',
        'Setup & Configuration'
    ],
    'Billing': [
        'Billing Concerns', 'Billing Issues', 'Billing Issue', 'Billing',
        'Billing/Non-Pay', 'General Issues/Billing', 'General/Billing'
    ],
    'Video': [
        'Video Service Issue', 'Picture Quality Issue', 'Missing Channels',

```

### Usage Example

```python
def assign_group(category):
    for group, categories in category_groups.items():
        if category in categories:
            return group
    return 'Other'

df['Category_Group'] = df['Category'].apply(assign_group)
```

## Notes on Category Variants

Many categories have multiple spelling/capitalization variants:
- Use **case-insensitive substring matching** when possible
- Standardize to main variant in analysis code
- Document which variant is considered "primary"

**Example:**
```python
def standardize_category(cat):
    cat_lower = cat.lower().strip()
    if 'dead air' in cat_lower and 'hang' in cat_lower:
        return 'Dead Air / Hang Up'
    if 'intermittent' in cat_lower and 'connect' in cat_lower:
        return 'Intermittent Connectivity Issues'
    # ... add more standardization rules
    return cat

df['Category_Std'] = df['Category'].apply(standardize_category)
```
